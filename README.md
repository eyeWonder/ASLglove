EE149 project

ASL Glove:

We created a glove able to interpret every gesture in the ASL alphabet and translate it to text and speech.
We did so by putting touch and flex sensors as well as an IMU embedded on the glove. We designed a sensing circuit 
embedded on the backside of the glove on a flexible PCB sheet as well a small PCB for interfacing with our microprocessor
placed on the wrist.
