ASL Glove:

Our sign language translation glove is able to translate every letter in the ASL alphabet to text and speech in real time,  with the goal of allowing the deaf to speak out. 
We were able to uniquely classify each gesture by analyzing the signals from 5 analog strain sensors, 7 touch sensors and 1 IMU. The whole system is powered by a 9V battery and it can be used as a wearable device with a small speaker. We designed and printed all the PCBs from scratch, sowed all the components on the glove ourselves and assembled the whole system in Jacobs and Cory Hall. 

We created a glove able to interpret every gesture in the ASL alphabet and translate it to text and speech.
We did so by putting touch and flex sensors as well as an IMU embedded on the glove. We designed a sensing circuit 
embedded on the backside of the glove on a flexible PCB sheet as well a small PCB for interfacing with our microprocessor
placed on the wrist.
